# The Performance Logbook

This is a template for a markdown based performance logbook for software developers and performance analysts. It helps to document activities and results in a structured manner without getting in your way. By using the logbook you also learn to employ best practice guidelines for a sensible performance engineering effort.

You find a general introduction to performance engineering in the [HPC Wiki](https://hpc-wiki.info/hpc/Performance_Engineering HPC Wiki).
