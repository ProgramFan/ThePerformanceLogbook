# The Performance Logbook

This is a template for a markdown based performance logbook for software developers and performance analysts. It helps to document activities and results in a structured manner without getting in your way. By using the logbook you also learn to employ best practice guidelines for a sensible performance engineering effort. Beyond the usage as a personal logbook it also serves as a well defined yet flexible and simple way to exchange and handover performance projects.

You find a general introduction to performance engineering in the [HPC Wiki](https://hpc-wiki.info/hpc/Performance_Engineering).

The logbook consists of a single markdown document, helper scripts, and directories with input, raw result and media files.
